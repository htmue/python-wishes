wishes
======

Run [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/)-style features as standard Python unittests.

The Cucumber step implementation snippets say something like this:

> *express the regexp above with the code you wish you had*

So Cucumber features bring wishes together: the features the stakeholders
wish to have, and the code the developers wish to have. It's all about wishes,
therfore we call this package ```wishes```.
